# Transept

Transept is a open source church software initative inspired by the [transept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transept) portion of a cruiciform church. It is not ment to be the main thing of the church but it is a supporting structural element.
This project was started out of a need for quality unified software for churches to use that is:
1. Free
2. Easy To Use
3. Looks Good
4. Is Effective
5. User First
6. Privacy and Security Focused

Therefore the goal of Transept is to create a line of FOSS software that covers the needs of a church, from presenting worship lyrics on a Sunday Service to Scheduling Volunteers and Providing anouncments. Eventually Transept will also support easy deploy servers for churches of any size to use this software with super charged by the server called a ChurchDeck.

## Core Philosophies

Beyond behing open source Transept also follows a set of philosiphies to allow for great church experences

1. File Over App. A philosophy coined by [Obsidian](obsidian.md) creator Kepano [^1] all files used by Transept software should be controable and readable by the user. Although this means users will not be locked in our ecosystem this encourages us to make an ecosystem that shares file structures with our competitors and generally a better ecosystem overall.
2. One Program, One Purpose. All applications should have a singular purpose. Although data might be shared among applicaitons each application should have a single purpose and keep its scope as narrow as possible.
3. Local First Data. All data should be local for any crictical software. This means that a Sunday service should be able to be run by a single machine on its own (though this may still be difficult).
4. Common Design. Use similar UI experences to allow for an easy transition between tools.
5. Interoperability. All software should try to share common standard file formats as often as possible
6. Privacy/Secuirty is Configurable. All data should be designed to allow for the highest security and privacy settings by default and should be configurable by a church to meet the need of their congregation
8. Logical Versioning. Version numbers should be easy to understand for the non-technical user.
9. Easy to Learn, Hard to Master. All applications/features should be easy to get started with for non-technical users but have a depth of funtionality to allow power users to do wonderful things
